The code you provided is an implementation of a maze solver using various search algorithms in Pygame. The program allows you to load a maze from a CSV file, choose a search algorithm, and visualize the solution path in a graphical user interface.

To run the program, you need to have Pygame installed. You can install Pygame by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

pip install pygame

Once Pygame is installed, you can run the program.

To use the program, you will be prompted to enter the maze file, enable verbose mode (optional), specify the reporting interval, pausing interval, and choose a search algorithm. The available search algorithms are:

Depth-First Search (DFS)
Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) using Manhattan Distance
Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) using Euclidean Distance
A* Search using Manhattan Distance
A* Search using Euclidean Distance
After selecting a search algorithm, the program will run the chosen algorithm on the maze and display the solution path in the Pygame window. If verbose mode is enabled, the program will provide additional information during the search process.

Note that the maze should be in CSV format, where each cell in the maze is represented by a character. The 'S' character represents the start position, the 'E' character represents the goal position, the '1' character represents a wall, and any other character represents an empty space.
